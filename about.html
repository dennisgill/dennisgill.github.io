    <h2> About Me</h2>
        <br>
    <p>I am third-year student pursuing my bachelors of science degree in the field of computer science and engineering at the University of California Davis. I am also double majoring in political science.</p> 
<br> 
<p>I’ve been interested in computers and programming since I was in high school. While in high school, I worked in the tech office servicing malfunctioning MacBooks. I replaced hardware components in the machines and loaded operating systems on them.</p>
<br> 
<p>I’ve held multiple positions	at the UC Davis Police Department. Beginning my career there as a AHS Officer, I was quickly promoted to lead supervisor for the student security division. I was placed in-charge for the successful deployment of our campus ride-hailing service. I worked with developers to improve and deploy the application web-wide. </p>
<br> 
<p>Thus far in college, I’ve taken: Introduction to Programming, Discrete Math, Data Structures, Object-Oriented Programming, Programming in Assembly Language, Computer Architecture, and Databases. </p>
